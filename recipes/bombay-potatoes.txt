Bombay Potatoes - Indian Spices
Serves 4-6, 45 minutes
Ingredients:
3 large potatoes
15g root ginger, peeled
3 garlic cloves
2 large tomatoes, one quartered, one cut in to slim wedges
4 tbsp vegetable oil
3/4 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 large onion
2/3 tsp tumeric
2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp garam masala
1/2-3/4 chili powder
Large handful of coriander (cilantro) leaves

Method:
1.) Bring a large pot of water to the boil and salt it well. Place in the potatoes and boil until just tender (up to 30 minutes). When cool enough to handle, peel and chop into 2.5cm cubes.
Blend together the ginger, garlic and quartered tomato until smooth.
Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the cumin and mustard seeds and, once the cumin starts to darken, add the onion. Cook for a minute before adding the ginger and garlic mixture, the ground spices and salt. Sauté gently for one to two minutes or until the garlic smells cooked. If you are not sure, taste; it should seem harmonious.
Add the tomato wedges, stir well and cook for three to four minutes. Tip in the potatoes and cook for three to five minutes to absorb the flavours. Check the seasoning, stir in the chopped coriander and serve.
